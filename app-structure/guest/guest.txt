[FRONTEND] Guest account nav bar:
    - home
    - about
    - rooms
    - amenities


[CONCEPT] Planner:
    - Each guest has a planner, kind of like a cart system in e-commerce websites.
    - These planners contain trips, each one stores the rooms that the user plans to book.
    - Each trip has a fixed checkin and checkout date.


[PROCESS] Guest makes a booking:
    1. Start a new trip.
    2. Confirm the check-in and check-out dates before proceeding.
        - Check-in time must be 2:00 PM. Check-out time must be 12:00 PM.
        - Guest must start a new trip or overwite the current one if they want to change these dates.
        - Guest cannot have trips with overlapping dates.
    3. Guest searches for hotel rooms by room type (only room types with available rooms will be shown).
        - Before the user adds the room to the trip, they can already add some amenities with the room.
        - Frontend should have a "Add another room with the same type and amenities"
        - Frontend should display how many rooms of the same room type are still available.
    4. Guest goes to their planner, views the trip they created.
        - Everything is editable aside from the checkin and checkout date of the trip
        - Should have a Save & Exit button
        - Guest should see a breakdown of costs before completing the booking
    5. Guest completes the booking, they must add their credit card info for hotel security.
